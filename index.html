				<h2>Attributes</h2>
				 All characters, most creatures, and some objects
					make use of a set of four attributes to describe
					their most fundamental capabilities. The
					attributes are: Strength, Agility, Intellect, and Will. <p></p>

					<h2>Strength</h2>
Strength represents muscle power, durability,
certain forms of athletic ability, and overall fitness.
You make a Strength roll to resist an effect that
forces you to move or that restrains you, as well as
when you climb, swim, <a href="#atta"><b>attack</b></a> with most hand-tohand
weapons, kick down a door, or overpower
another creature. You also use Strength to
withstand or fight off the effects of pain, injury,
poison, or infection. <p></p>

<h2>Agility</h2>
Agility encompasses poise, dexterity, balance, and
reflexes. You make an Agility roll when you want
to keep your balance, perhaps because someone
has just shoved you or you are moving across
challenging terrain. Agility also comes Into play
when you would try to accomplish a task that
requires manual dexterity, such as picking a lock,
disarming a trap, or performing an act of
legerdemain.<p></p>

<h2>Intellect</h2>
Intellect measures of intelligence, wit, memory,
and knowledge. You make an Intellect roll to
thwart an effort to deceive you, decipher a coded
message, or outwit another creature. Intellect also
affects your ability to use some forms of magic
successfully.<p></p>

<h2>Will</h2>
Will describes courage, willpower, resolve, and
mental fortitude. You make a Will roll to resist an
effort to erode your confidence, manipulate your
emotions, or terrify you. As with Intellect, Will is
also needed to use some forms of magic
successfully.<p></p>
			</div>
			</div>

		<div class="modal" id="roll">
			<a href="#_" class="modal-close"></a>
			<div class="modal-dialog">
				<h2>Rolls</h2>
				Roll a d20, add
					the modifier for your <a href="#att"><b>attribute</b></a>, and then compare
					the result to the target number. You get a success if
					the result equals or exceeds the target number or
					a failure if it doesn't. <p></p>

					<h2>Luck Rolls</h2>
			
				Sometimes, the rules or Sage calls for a luck roll to
see what happens. A luck roll uses no <a href="#att"><b>attribute</b></a>, so
its just a roll of a d20. Since you never make a luck
roll against a creature or object, the target is
always 10. <p>
</p>
<h3> Luck Ends</h3>
	 If you are under the effects of an
	effect that has the (luck ends) notation, you make
	a luck roll at the end of the round. If you have
	multiple (luck ends) effects affecting you, you
	make the luck roll for each effect, in any order you
	choose. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure,
	the effect persists at least until the end of the next
	round, at which point you repeat the luck roll to
	end the effect.
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="modal" id="boon">
			<a href="#_" class="modal-close"></a>
			<div class="modal-dialog">
				<h2>Boons and Banes</h2>
				A boon is an advantageous circumstance that
					improves your chance of success. For each boon
					that applies, you roll a boon die, which is a d6. You
					then add the highest number rolled on any one of
					the d6s to your <a href="#att"><b>attribute</b></a> roll.
					<p></p>
					A bane is a disadvantage that reduces your
					chance of success. For each bane that applies, you
					roll a bane die, which is a d6. You then subtract the
					highest number rolled on any one of the d6s from
					your <a href="#att"><b>attribute</b></a> roll.<p></p>
					Boons and banes cancel each other out on a one-for-one basis before any boon dice or bane dice
					are rolled.
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="modal" id="chi">
			<a href="#_" class="modal-close"></a>
			<div class="modal-dialog">
				
				 <h2>Health</h2>
					Health describes how much damage a creature or
					object can take. It represents one’s durability,
					resilience, stamina, and ability to avoid lasting
					injury from being attacked. You have a maximum
					Health score, which tells you the maximum
					damage a creature or object can take, with any
					damage taken in excess of the Health score
					ignored, and a current Health score, which reflects
					gains and losses to Health. <p></p>
					Many effects can change your Health score, which
enables you to take more damage before falling
down, or less, which makes you more fragile.
Changes to your Health score affect your
maximum damage total. <p></p>

<h2>Damage</h2>

Damage describes attrition done to your person
from a harmful effect. You keep a running total of
damage accumulated. Your damage total can be as
low as 0 or as high as your Health score. When you
take damage, you add the amount to your damage
total. When you heal damage, subtract the amount
from your damage total. <p></p>

<h2>Defense</h2>
Defense shows how reflexes, combat training,
instinct, and protective equipment contribute to a
creature or object’s ability to escape harm from
attacks.

<h3>Natural Defense </h3> All creatures and objects
capable of defending themselves have an natural
Defense score. This score is usually 10. Your path
determines your natural Defense score. Paths can
increase your score, as can magic effects. If you
wear armor, you replace your natural Defense
score with the number granted by the armor. If
you use a shield, you increase your armored
Defense score or natural Defense by the indicated
number.
<p></p>

<h2>Bonus Damage</h2>
					 If you chose a path that grants bonus damage, you
						can apply the bonus damage as extra damage once
						per <a href="#gen"><b>round</b></a> when you succeed on a roll to <a href="#atta"><b>attack</b></a>
						and use a weapon or a natural weapon (though
						not improvised weapons or unarmed attacks).
						Simply roll the dice from the bonus damage and
						add it to the damage dealt by the <a href="#atta"><b>attack</b></a>. Some
						weapon properties limit on how much bonus
						damage you can apply to an <a href="#atta"><b>attack</b></a>.


			</div>
			</div>

		<div class="modal" id="iad">
			<a href="#_" class="modal-close"></a>
			<div class="modal-dialog">
				<h2>Injured</h2>
				
You are injured if your <a href="#chi"><b>damage</b></a> total equals or
exceeds half your <a href="#chi"><b>Health</b></a> score. Typically, you
suffer no effects from being injured, but certain
talents, spells, and other effects used against you
might put you at a disadvantage because you're
injured. <p></p>
<h2>Incapacitated</h2>
When your <a href="#chi"><b>damage</b></a> total equals your <a href="#chi"><b>Health</b></a> score,
you fall <a href="#aff"><b>prone</b></a> and become incapacitated. While
you’re incapacitated, you are unconscious. If you
take any <a href="#chi"><b>damage</b></a> while incapacitated, you lose
<a href="#chi"><b>Health</b></a> equal to the <a href="#chi"><b>damage</b></a> you took. <p></p>
If you're incapacitated at the end of the <a href="#gen"><b>round</b></a>,
lose 1d6 <a href="#chi"><b>Health</b></a> and make a <a href="#roll"><b>luck</b></a> roll. On a success,
you heal 1 <a href="#chi"><b>damage</b></a>, and you are no longer
incapacitated. On a failure, you remain
incapacitated. <p></p>

<h2>Unconscious</h2>
You cannot use actions or <a href="#gen"><b>reactions</b></a>. Your Speed
drops 0 and you cannot benefit from increases to
Speed until this <a href="#aff"><b>affliction</b></a> ends. You receive no
information from your senses. You grant 3 <a href="#boon"><b>boons</b></a>
on rolls against you, and you automatically fail all
<a href="#att"><b>attribute</b></a> rolls.<p></p>

When you take <a href="#chi"><b>damage</b></a>, you first lose <a href="#chi"><b>Health</b></a>
equal to the amount of <a href="#chi"><b>damage</b></a> you would take
and then take the <a href="#chi"><b>damage</b></a>. For example, if you
have <a href="#chi"><b>Health</b></a> 12 and take 6 <a href="#chi"><b>damage</b></a> while you are
unconscious, you would reduce your <a href="#chi"><b>Health</b></a> to 6
and then take 6 <a href="#chi"><b>damage</b></a>, which would cause you to
become incapacitated. <p></p>

<h2>Death</h2>
If you die and the cause of death does not destroy
your body, your remains become an object with
<a href="#chi"><b>Health</b></a> 20. Remains of organic material
decay, losing 1d6 <a href="#chi"><b>Health</b></a> (or more in warm, moist
conditions) each day until they completely rot
away. If an effect would restore you to life, any loss
of <a href="#chi"><b>Health</b></a> to your corpse acts as a permanent
reduction to your <a href="#chi"><b>Health</b></a> score, reflecting the
ravages of decay, lost body parts, and so on.

			<div class="modal-dialog">
				<h2>Afflictions</h2>
				Harmful effects bestow afflictions, which limit
				what you can do on your turn, make certain rolls
				more difficult, or both. You can gain the same
				affliction multiple times, provided the affliction
				comes from a different source, and you must
				remove each instance of the affliction separately.<p></p>

				<h2>Asleep</h2>
If you are <a href="#iad"><b>unconscious</b></a> because you are sleeping
naturally, you stop being <a href="#iad"><b>unconscious</b></a> when a
creature uses an action to shake you, kick you, or
do something else to waken you. A loud noise
might remove the affliction if you succeed on a
<a href="#roll"><b>luck</b></a> roll. Time spent sleeping counts as resting for
the purpose of healing <a href="#chi"><b>damage</b></a>. If your sleep is uninterrupted, you wake
up naturally whenever you choose hours after you
fall asleep. <p></p>
				
				<h2>Blinded</h2>
You cannot see and thus have line of sight to
nothing. If you would <a href="#atta"><b>attack</b></a> or interact with
anything, you must guess the target’s location or
locate the target using other senses. Finally, you
halve your Speed.<p></p>

<h2>Confused</h2>
You become unable to make sense of what is
happening around you. You cannot use <a href="#gen"><b>reactions</b></a>,
you grant 1 <a href="#boon"><b>boon</b></a> on rolls against you, and you
make <a href="#att"><b>Intellect</b></a> and <a href="#att"><b>Will</b></a> rolls with 1 <a href="#boon"><b>bane</b></a>.<p></p>

<h2>Controlled</h2>
You fall under control of the source of this
affliction. You take your turn when your controller
does and it decides what you do on your turn. If
you have already taken a turn when you gain this
affliction, you take a turn as described during the
next <a href="#gen"><b>round</b></a>.<p></p>

<h2>Cursed</h2>
You make <a href="#roll"><b>luck</b></a> rolls with 1 <a href="#boon"><b>bane</b></a>.<p></p>

<h2>Deafened</h2>
You cannot hear.<p></p>

<h2>Frightened</h2>
You fear the source of this affliction—a creature,
an object, a space, or something else. While you
have line of sight to the source of your fear, you
make <a href="#att"><b>attribute</b></a> rolls with 1 <a href="#boon"><b>bane</b></a>, and you grant 1
<a href="#boon"><b>boon</b></a> on <a href="#att"><b>attribute</b></a> rolls against you.<p></p>

<h2>Held</h2>
Your Speed drops to 0 and you cannot benefit from
increases to your Speed until this affliction ends.<p></p>

<h2>Impaired</h2>
The impaired affliction affects the <a href="#att"><b>attribute</b></a>
specified by the harmful effect, so you might be
<a href="#att"><b>Strength</b></a> impaired or <a href="#att"><b>Intellect</b></a> impaired, for
instance. Your roll with 1 <a href="#boon"><b>bane</b></a> when using the
specified <a href="#att"><b>attribute</b></a>, and you grant 1 <a href="#boon"><b>boon</b></a> on rolls
against the specified <a href="#att"><b>attribute</b></a>.<p></p>

<h2>On Fire</h2>
You catch fire. You take 1d6 <a href="#chi"><b>damage</b></a> at the end of
each <a href="#gen"><b>round</b></a> until the fire is extinguished, which is
normally accomplished with a successful <a href="#roll"><b>luck</b></a> roll. You can also use an action to
overcome the flames by making a successful
<a href="#att"><b>Agility</b></a> roll or by using an action to douse the
flames with water or smother them with a blanket 
or similar object. A creature that drops prone
before trying to overcome the flames makes the
roll with 1 <a href="#boon"><b>boon</b></a>.<p></p>

<h2>Poisoned</h2>
You have been exposed to venom, poison, or some
other toxin. You make <a href="#att"><b>attribute</b></a> rolls with 1 <a href="#boon"><b>bane</b></a>,
and you grant 1 <a href="#boon"><b>boon</b></a> on rolls against you. In
addition, at the end of each <a href="#gen"><b>round</b></a>, you lose 1d6
<a href="#chi"><b>Health</b></a>.<p></p>

<h2>Prone</h2>
You are lying on the ground. You cannot use
<a href="#gen"><b>reactions</b></a>. You grant 1 <a href="#boon"><b>boon</b></a> on rolls made to <a href="#atta"><b>attack</b></a>
you with melee weapons, but impose 1 <a href="#boon"><b>bane</b></a> on
rolls made to <a href="#atta"><b>attack</b></a> you with ranged weapons. You
can use your move to crawl or stand up only.<p></p>

<h2>Stunned</h2>
You cannot use actions or <a href="#gen"><b>reactions</b></a>. Your Speed
drops to 0 and you cannot benefit from increases
to Speed until this affliction ends. You grant 2
<a href="#boon"><b>boons</b></a> on rolls against you, and you make <a href="#att"><b>attribute</b></a>
rolls with 2 <a href="#boon"><b>banes</b></a>.<p></p>

<h2>Weakened</h2>
You make <a href="#att"><b>Strength</b></a> and <a href="#att"><b>Agility</b></a> rolls with 1 <a href="#boon"><b>bane</b></a>,
and you grant 1 <a href="#boon"><b>boon</b></a> on rolls against your
<a href="#att"><b>Strength</b></a> and <a href="#att"><b>Agility</b></a>. In addition, you halve your
Speed, and you derive no benefit from increases to
your Speed.

				<h2>Disposition</h2>
How a person sees you, whether they like you or
not, can go a long way toward deciding whether
they are willing to help you. A friendly person is
more likely to do you a favor than will an
indifferent one. Creatures you meet have a
disposition toward you, other characters in your
group, and other people as well. The dispositions
follow: <p></p>
<b>Friendly</b> The person likes you and helps you if
they can. <br>
<b>Indifferent</b> The person has no opinion toward
you, one way or the other. <br>
<b>Unfriendly</b> The person dislikes you and helps
you only if they have no choice.<p>

</p>
<h2>Reading Dispositions</h2>
Unless a person has some reason to hide their
disposition, how they see you should be evident in
what they say and how they act around you. If a
person hides their true feelings from you, the Sage
might make <a href="#att"><b>Will</b></a> rolls for the person to see if they
can keep their true feelings to themselves. Rather
than ask to make a roll, spend time with the
character in question, observe them, and talk to
them. The truth will come out eventually. Magic
might also reveal a person’s true feelings.
<p>	</p>

<h2>Social Challenges</h2>
A social challenge happens whenever you cause
another creature to behave in a certain way by
using conversation. The desired behavior
responsible for the social challenge can be almost
anything, from the revelation of a secret to some
action you want the subject to perform. In each
case, though, the behavior represents something
the person would not normally do, from risks,
disinterest, or dislike. <p></p>

				<h2>Battlefield</h2>
				A combat takes place on a battlefield, a place large
enough to encompass all the combatants. The Sage describes the battlefield
before the combat begins and notes any obvious
features and threats present. The Sage
will sketch out the battlefield into
discrete zones to give you a visual representation. <p></p>

<h2>Turns</h2>
Each round, all the combatants under the Sage’s
control take their turns first, acting in any order
the Sage chooses. Each combatant must complete
its turn before another can take its turn. The Sage can change the order in which these combatants
resolve their turn each round. <p></p>
Once all combatants under the Sage’s control
have taken their turns, the players take their turns.
Players can declare they are taking their turns in
any order they like each round. <p></p>

<h2>Reactions</h2>
Each combatant can act out of turn just once each
round by using a reaction. <p></p>

<h2>Combat Circumstances</h2>
				Certain circumstances can make attacking harder
					or easier. The following situations represent those
					most commonly encountered in a fight. <p></p>

					<b>Surrounded Target</b> When you make a melee
<a href="#atta"><b>attack</b></a> against a target that has been attacked by
an ally using a melee weapon in the same round,
you roll with 1 <a href="#boon"><b>boon</b></a>.<p></p>

<b>Long Range Shooting</b> When you make a ranged
<a href="#atta"><b>attack</b></a> you can target a creature beyond your
weapon’s range, but no more than twice its range.
You roll to <a href="#atta"><b>attack</b></a> with 1 <a href="#boon"><b>bane</b></a>. <p></p>

<b>High Ground</b> When you occupy a space higher
than that occupied by the target of your <a href="#atta"><b>attack</b></a>,
you roll with 1 <a href="#boon"><b>boon</b></a>. <p></p>

<b>Within Reach of an Enemy</b> If you make a
ranged <a href="#atta"><b>attack</b></a> while in the reach of at least one
enemy, you roll with 1 <a href="#boon"><b>bane</b></a>. <p></p>

<b>Obscurement</b> You roll to <a href="#atta"><b>attack</b></a> with 1 <a href="#boon"><b>bane</b></a>
while you are in an area affected by obscurement
of any kind. <p></p>

<b>Invisible</b> If you can’t see the target, but have a
general idea about the target’s location, you roll
with 3 <a href="#boon"><b>banes</b></a>. <p></p>

<b>Cover</b> A target positioned behind an obstacle of
its size or larger (which can be a creature or an
object) has partial cover from enemies that can
see any part of its body, but not all of it. Partial
cover imposes 1 <a href="#boon"><b>bane</b></a> on rolls against the covered
target’s <a href="#chi"><b>Defense</b></a> and <a href="#att"><b>Agility</b></a>, and grants the target
1 <a href="#boon"><b>boon</b></a> on <a href="#att"><b>Agility</b></a> rolls made to resist harmful
effects originating from beyond cover. <p></p>
A target has total cover from enemies if there is
no line of sight to it because the target is behind an
obstacle and cannot be seen by an enemy. Such a
target cannot be directly attacked or affected by an
effect unless the rules say otherwise. Instead,
attacks against the target strike the obstacle. If the
obstacle is destroyed as a result, any additional
<a href="#chi"><b>damage</b></a> dealt by that <a href="#atta"><b>attack</b></a> or effect is applied to
whatever was behind the obstacle. <p></p>
Note that these rules apply in situations when
an attacker cannot position itself to get a clear
shot against a target. <p>	</p>

			<div class="modal-dialog">
				<h2>Moves</h2>
You can move a number of yards equal to your
Speed score using your primary mode of
locomotion—walking, rolling, slithering, or
fluttering.
You can spend yards of movement to move in
special ways.<p></p>

<b>Climb</b>
You can climb surfaces that have handholds and
footholds, or when you have a rope. For every 2
yards of movement you expend, you can climb up,
down, or across a distance of 1 yard.<p></p>

<b>Crawl</b>
You crawl while <a href="#aff"><b>prone</b></a>. For every 2 yards of
movement, you crawl 1 yard across a surface on
which you lay <a href="#aff"><b>prone</b></a>.<p></p>

<b>Drop Prone</b>
You can expend 1 yard of movement to drop to the
surface on which you are standing. You become
<a href="#aff"><b>prone</b></a>.<p></p>

<b>Fly</b>
If you can fly, thanks to a trait, magical talent, or
spell, you can fly 2 yards for yard of movement you
expend. Once airborne, you remain so until you
land, the effect enabling your ability fly ends, or
something causes you to land. <p></p>

<b>Jump and Leap</b>
You can expend 2 yards of movement to jump or
leap. <p></p>

<b>Mount and Dismount</b>
You can expend 3 yards of movement to mount a
friendly Mount within reach or dismount a Mount
you are riding. When you
dismount, you move from the creature’s space into
an empty space of your choice within 1 yard of the
mount. <p></p>

<b>Retreat</b>
When you are in the reach of an enemy, you can
retreat to safely move out of its reach. For each
yard you would move, expend 1 additional yard of
movement, preventing the enemy from making a
<a href="#Free Attack"><b>free attack</b></a> against you. <p></p>

<b>Sneak</b>
You attempt to move without making much, if any,
sound. For every 2 yards of movement you spend,
you sneak 1 yard across the surface on which you
are standing.<p></p>

<b>Stand Up</b>
If you are <a href="#aff"><b>prone</b></a>, you can expend 4 yards of
movement to stand up, thus ending the <a href="#aff"><b>prone</b></a>
<a href="#aff"><b>affliction</b></a>.<p></p>

<b>Swim</b>
You can swim in just about any liquid, though
immersing yourself in acid or toxic goo is never a
good idea. For every 2 yards of movement you
expend, you swim 1 yard in any direction inside
the liquid.<p></p>

<b>Teleportation</b>
Magical effects can transport you, along with
whatever you are wearing and carrying, from one
place to another in an instant. When you appear in
the new location, you do so in the same
orientation and posture had when you left the
previous position. <P></P>

<h2>Movement Activities</h2>
You can spend movement to perform minor
activities chosen from the following options by
expending 2 yards of movement for each activity:<br>
• Open an unlocked door, open a chest, or some
other container in your reach.<br>
• Retrieve an item from your backpack or some
other container you carry.<br>
• Pick something up off the ground.<br>
• Pull a lever or interact with an object in reach.<br>
• Any other physical activity that involves
movement and does not require an <a href="#att"><b>attribute</b></a> roll
either to perform it or resist it.<br><p></p>

<h2>Movement Complications</h2>
Various complications, coming from effects that
target you or from the nature of your
environment, might restrict your movement. <p></p>

<b>Being Moved</b>
An effect that forces you to move propels you in
the direction and to the distance indicated unless
you encounter an obstacle that prevents you from
continuing to move. If being moved would expose
you to peril, such as pushing you over the edge of a
cliff or into a fire, you can make a <a href="#roll"><b>luck</b></a> roll and, on
a success, you drop <a href="#aff"><b>prone</b></a> at the edge of the
danger. Being moved in this way does not enable
enemies to make <a href="#Free Attack"><b>free attack</b></a> against you.<p></p>

<b>Moving Out of Reach</b>
If you move out of the reach of one or more
enemies, you trigger a <a href="#Free Attack"><b>free attack</b></a> from each
enemy whose reach you leave. <p></p>

				<h2>Rest</h2>
Characters have many ways to heal <a href="#chi"><b>damage</b></a> and
regain <a href="#chi"><b>Health</b></a>. They might avail themselves of
poultices, elixirs, spells, talents, and other game
effects. But the most reliable way to recover from
injuries comes from resting. <p></p>
Resting allows you to heal <a href="#chi"><b>damage</b></a> and regain
expended resources. If you have uninterrupted
rest for 8 consecutive hours, you heal all <a href="#chi"><b>damage</b></a>,
and you regain <a href="#chi"><b>Health</b></a> equal one-tenth your
normal <a href="#chi"><b>Health</b></a> score (round down). Some of your
other resources might also be replenished after a
rest. If you stop resting to use an action or
<a href="#gen"><b>reactions</b></a>, the time you have spent continuously
resting is wasted and you must start resting again
to gain any benefit from doing so.<p></p>

<h2>Knowledge</h2>
			 All people know how to do certain things and can
				agree that some things count as facts. As a person
				living in this world, you know the following things.
				This list isn’t meant to be exhaustive; it sketches
				out the parameters for what a typical person
				ought to know.<br>
				• How to build and maintain a fire. <br>
				• How to forage for food.<br>
				• How to dress and prepare meat from animal
				you kill.<br>
				• How to identify water that’s safe to drink.<br>
• How to make use of all the equipment.<br>
• How to maintain your equipment.<br>
• The basic features of the land you inhabit
and what’s around these lands.<br>
• That magic exists. You also know the gods
sometimes walk the lands and bestow
powers onto their servants.<br>
• A bit about the major religions, their
doctrines, and their dogma.<br>
• How to care for and feed an animal.<br>
• How to conduct commerce.<br>
• How to feed, clothe, bathe yourself, and tend
to your other physical needs.<br>
• How to read and write.<br>
• The seasons and their passage, weather, the
major constellations, and other phenomena
related to living in a world.<br>
• Identify common creatures you see.<br>
• Anything else that a person would know
who lives in a pre-industrial society.<br> <p></p>

<h2>Professional Knowledge</h2>

In addition to knowledge held in common with
most other people, you also have knowledge
related to your profession, as well as to the paths
you have chosen.<p></p>

<b>Stories and Legends</b> You can recall details
about legendary members of your profession, as
well as famous and infamous members of your
profession from in and around the lands in which
you live. If you are a blacksmith and have worked
as a blacksmith in a particular town, you know if
there’s a famous blacksmith the next town over.
<p></p>

<b>Tasks and Activities</b> You know how to perform
tasks and activities directly related to your
profession. If you’re a scribe, you know how to
illuminate a manuscript. If you’re a poet, you can
produce poetry. If you are a criminal, you can
probably unlock a lock using lockpicks.
For difficult tasks directly related to your
profession, you and you alone can perform the
task. A person who is not a forger could not
produce a believable forgery, for example. In
addition, when performing such tasks, the Sage
might grant an automatic success or 1 <a href="#boon"><b>boon</b></a> or
more to your <a href="#att"><b>attribute</b></a> roll.

<p></p>
<b>Competence</b> You count as being competent in
any work you perform related to your profession.
Between quests, if you can find work, you know
how to perform in your profession with the ability
to provide for yourself at a quality of life typical
for a member of your profession.

<p></p>
<b>Eye for Quality</b> You can identify the quality of
any good or service produced by a member of
your profession. You can identify good writing if a
writer, good or bad cooking as a cook, fine or
terrible service if a servant.

<p></p>
<b>Tangential Benefits</b> Your profession might also
grant benefits on tasks not directly related to your
work at the Sage’s discretion. The benefit might
make an impossible task possible for you, or make
difficult tasks easier. The Sage might also reveal
additional information in descriptions based on
your expertise. <p></p>

<h2>Deprivation</h2>
If you are a living being, you need food and water
to survive. If you go without either, you suffer
deprivation until you expire. Normally, provisions
and waterskins can keep these effects at bay, but if
you run out of water or someone makes off with
your food, you might be in trouble. You need to
spend at least 1 hour each day eating at least two
meals and drinking at least a half-gallon of water.
A small creature requires half these quantities,
while a large creature required four times these
amounts or more.
<p></p>
Each day you go without drinking sufficient
amounts of water, you lose 1d6 <a href="#chi"><b>Health</b></a>. Every two
days you go without eating, you lose 1d6 <a href="#chi"><b>Health</b></a>. If
your <a href="#chi"><b>Health</b></a> drops to 5 or lower, you fall <a href="#aff"><b>prone</b></a> and
become <a href="#aff"><b>weakened</b></a> until your <a href="#chi"><b>Health</b></a> score
increases above 5. While <a href="#aff"><b>weakened</b></a> in this way,
you cannot stand up and can move only by
crawling. <p></p>

<h2>Sleep Deprivation</h2>
You need sleep to refresh yourself. Unless your
ancestry says otherwise, you need at least six
hours of sleep every day. If you go a day without
sleep, you become <a href="#aff"><b>weakened</b></a> until you do sleep.
Every day you go without sleep thereafter, you
take 1d6 <a href="#chi"><b>damage</b></a>.

				<h2>Attack</h2>
				You attack when you use a weapon, natural
				weapon, improvised weapon, or an unarmed to
				harm a creature or object.  <p></p>

				<b>Weapons</b>
				A weapon is an object constructed for the purpose
				of harming others and includes swords, axes, and
				the like. A weapon is either melee, for use in handto-
				hand combat, or ranged. Many weapons have
				properties that can affect how you use them.<p></p>

				<b>Natural Weapons</b>
				A natural weapon is part of the creature’s body
				that can harm others. Examples include horns,
				spiked tails, claws, and teeth. A creature with a
				natural weapon is always wielding a melee
				weapon and cannot be disarmed. For the purpose
				of attacking with two weapons, natural weapons
				count as off-hand weapons.<p></p>

				<b>Improvised Weapons</b>
				An improvised weapon is an object constructed
				for a function other than harm but nevertheless
				can cause injury. Examples include frying pans and
				broken bottles. When you use an improvised
				weapon to attack, you roll with 1 <a href="#boon"><b>bane</b></a>. If the result
				of the roll is 0 or less or 20 or higher, the
				improvised weapon breaks. An improvised
				weapon deals 1d6 <a href="#chi"><b>damage</b></a> and derives no benefit
				from <a href="#chi"><b>bonus</b></a> damage.

<h2>Attack Options</h2>

Once per <a href="#gen"><b>round</b></a>, when you use an action to <a href="#atta"><b>attack</b></a>,
you can avail yourself of one of the following
attack options provided you meet the
requirements for doing so. To use an attack option,
you must have at least 1 a <a href="#boon"><b>boon</b></a> on your roll to
<a href="#atta"><b>attack</b></a>, after accounting for <a href="#boon"><b>banes</b></a>. You then
discard any remaining a <a href="#boon"><b>boons</b></a> and resolve the
<a href="#atta"><b>attack</b></a> as normal, with the following additional
effects.
<p></p>

<b>Aggressive Attack</b>  
You can use this option
when you <a href="#atta"><b>attack</b></a> with a weapon that has a onehanded
or two-handed grip If the result is a
success, add half your level (minimum 1) as extra
damage to the <a href="#atta"><b>attack</b></a>.<p></p>

<b>Combination Attack</b> You can use this option if
you have at least one hand free. On a success, you
can make an unarmed attack against the same
target you attacked.<p></p>

<b>Distracting Attack</b> 
On a success, the target also
grants 1 <a href="#boon"><b>boon</b></a> on the next roll to attack it before
the start of your next turn.<p></p>

<b>Driving Attack</b> 
You can use this option when
you <a href="#atta"><b>attack</b></a> a target of your size + 1 or smaller with
a weapon that has a one-handed or two-handed
grip or you <a href="#atta"><b>attack</b></a> with any weapon while you
have a shield equipped. On a success, you also
push the target up to 5 yards. <p></p>

<b>Feinting Attack</b> You can use this option when
you <a href="#atta"><b>attack</b></a> when you wield weapon with a onehanded
or off-handed grip, but not a two-handed
grip. On a success, you also become Slippery until
the end of your turn.

<b>Guarded Attack</b> 
You can use this option when
you <a href="#atta"><b>attack</b></a> while you are equipped with a shield or
you have a weapon in your off-hand. On a success,
you also impose 1 <a href="#boon"><b>bane</b></a> on rolls to <a href="#atta"><b>attack</b></a> you until
the start of your next turn. The benefit ends early
if you become <a href="#aff"><b>confused, held, stunned, or
	unconscious</b></a>. <p></p>


<b>Lunging Attack</b> 
You can use this option when
you wield a weapon that has one-handed or twohanded
grip. You can increase your reach by 1
yard for the purpose of choosing a target for the
<a href="#atta"><b>attack</b></a> you make with the weapon you are
wielding. However, on a success, the <a href="#atta"><b>attack</b></a> deals
half damage. <p></p>

<b>Pressing Attack</b> 
On a success, the target also
makes its next roll to attack before the start of
your next turn with 1 <a href="#boon"><b>bane</b></a>. <p></p>


<h2>Unarmed Attacks</h2> 
					There are several ways to make an unarmed
					<a href="#atta"><b>attack</b></a>, each of which are described below. <p></p>
					<b>Unarmed Strike</b>
You punch, kick, elbow, or headbutt. Choose one
creature in reach. Make a <a href="#att"><b>Strength</b></a> roll with 1 <a href="#boon"><b>bane</b></a>
against the target’s <a href="#chi"><b>Defense</b></a>. On a success, the
target takes 1d6 <a href="#chi"><b>damage</b></a>. If the target is larger
than you, it instead takes 1 <a href="#chi"><b>damage</b></a>.
					<p> <b>Shove</b>
						You attempt to shove a creature away from you.
						Choose one creature in reach whose size is no
						more than 2 higher than yours. Make a <a href="#att"><b>Strength</b></a>
						roll against the target’s <a href="#att"><b>Strength</b></a>. You roll with 1
						<a href="#boon"><b>boon</b></a> if you are using a shield and 1 <a href="#boon"><b>boon</b></a> if you
						moved at least 5 yards before you make the
						attempt. On a success, you push the target a
						number of yards away from you equal to your
						<a href="#att"><b>Strength</b></a> modifier (minimum 1). If the target is
						larger than you, it moves half the distance
						(minimum 0) instead. If the result of your roll is 20
						or higher, the target falls <a href="#aff"><b>prone</b></a>.

						<p></p>
						<b>Trip</b>
						You attempt to knock a creature to the ground.
Choose one creature in your reach whose size is
no more than 2 higher than yours. Make an <a href="#att"><b>Agility</b></a>
roll against the target’s choice of <a href="#att"><b>Strength</b></a> or
<a href="#att"><b>Agility</b></a>. If you are using a shield, you roll with 1
<a href="#boon"><b>boon</b></a>. On a success, the target falls <a href="#aff"><b>prone</b></a>. If the
result of your roll is 20 or higher, the target’s
Speed drops to 0 until the start of your next turn. <p></p>
<b>Grab</b>
You try to grab a creature. Choose one creature in
your reach whose size is no more than 1 higher
than yours. Make a <a href="#att"><b>Strength</b></a> or <a href="#att"><b>Agility</b></a> roll against
the target's <a href="#att"><b>Agility</b></a>. You succeed automatically
against a <a href="#aff"><b>held</b></a> creature. On a success, the target
becomes <a href="#aff"><b>held</b></a> until the end of your next turn. The
<a href="#aff"><b>affliction</b></a> ends early if you release the target,
which you can do freely. The effect also ends if you
move away from the target without dragging it
(see Drag) or you become <a href="#aff"><b>confused</b></a>, <a href="#aff"><b>controlled</b></a>,
<a href="#aff"><b>stunned</b></a>, or <a href="#iad"><b>unconscious</b></a>.
If you have a target grabbed, you can use an
action extend the duration until the end of your
next turn.
<p></p>
<b>Drag</b>
You attempt to pull a creature you have <a href="#aff"><b>held</b></a> with
you. Make a <a href="#att"><b>Strength</b></a> roll against the <a href="#att"><b>Strength</b></a> of a creature <a href="#aff"><b>held</b></a> by your successful grab. On a
success, you move as normal and the creature
moves with you. <p></p>

<b>Wrestle</b>
You attempt to wrestle down a creature you have
grabbed. Make a <a href="#att"><b>Strength</b></a> or <a href="#att"><b>Agility</b></a> roll against the
target’s choice of <a href="#att"><b>Strength</b></a> or <a href="#att"><b>Agility</b></a>. On a success,
you can choose one of the following effects:
<br>• The target falls <a href="#aff"><b>prone</b></a> and the grab effect ends.
<br>• You and the target falls <a href="#aff"><b>prone</b></a>.
<br>• The target takes 1d6 <a href="#chi"><b>damage</b></a>.
<br>• If you and the target are both <a href="#aff"><b>prone</b></a>, you pin the
target. A pinned creature is <a href="#aff"><b>confused</b></a>, <a href="#aff"><b>held</b></a>,
<a href="#aff"><b>weakened</b></a>, and cannot stand up until the effect
ends. The target remains until you release it,
which you can do at any time, you stand up or
you use an action to do anything other than
wrestle the target. Also, you release a target
automatically if you become <a href="#aff"><b>confused</b></a>, <a href="#aff"><b>impaired</b></a>,
<a href="#aff"><b>stunned</b></a>, or <a href="#aff"><b>weakened</b></a>. <p></p>

<b> Escape</b>
If you are <a href="#aff"><b>held</b></a> from being grabbed or pinned, you
can attempt to escape by making a <a href="#att"><b>Strength</b></a> or
<a href="#att"><b>Agility</b></a> roll against the <a href="#att"><b>Strength</b></a> or <a href="#att"><b>Agility</b></a> of the
creature that has you <a href="#aff"><b>held</b></a>. On a success, you end
the <a href="#aff"><b>held</b></a> <a href="#aff"><b>affliction</b></a>. If the result of your roll is 20 or
higher and exceeds the target number by at least
5, you can also automatically grab the creature
that had grabbed you or pin the creature that had
you pinned provided the creature can be a
legitimate target for your grab. <p></p>

<h2>Special Attacks</h2> 
					You might avail yourself of the special attacks
commonly available to most creatures.
					<p> <b>Attacking with Two Weapons </b>
						If you wield two
						weapons, one in each hand, you can <a href="#atta"><b>attack</b></a> with
						both weapons at the same time. When you do so,
						only the properties from the weapon you wield in
						your main hand apply. If the <a href="#atta"><b>attack</b></a> results in a
						success, add the <a href="#chi"><b>damage</b></a> from the weapon you
						wield in your off-hand as extra <a href="#chi"><b>damage</b></a> to the
						<a href="#atta"><b>attack</b></a>.
						If you can wield more than two weapons at a
						time, you can, at most, <a href="#atta"><b>attack</b></a> with two weapons
						and choose which weapons with which you <a href="#atta"><b>attack</b></a>
						when you <a href="#atta"><b>attack</b></a>. <p></p>

						<b>Called Shot </b>
						You make a called shot when you
						target for a particular location on a target’s body
						or something the target wears or carries. You roll
						with 1 <a href="#boon"><b>bane</b></a> when you make a called shot for your
						<a href="#atta"><b>attack</b></a>. On a success and if you targeted a spot on
						the target’s body, the target becomes <a href="#aff"><b>impaired</b></a> in
						an <a href="#att"><b>attribute</b></a> of your choice until the end of your
						next turn. If you targeted something the target
						wears or carries, the object takes the <a href="#chi"><b>damage</b></a>
						instead. <p></p>

						<b>Charge</b>
						 Use an action to charge one creature or
						object you can see. Double your Speed score until
						the end of your turn. If you move toward the target
						and can reach it before the end of your turn, you
						can <a href="#atta"><b>attack</b></a> it with a weapon or an unarmed <a href="#atta"><b>attack</b></a>,
						but you roll with 1 <a href="#boon"><b>bane</b></a>. <p></p>

						<b>Disarm</b> 
						Use an action to attempt to disarm a
						creature of your size or smaller when you <a href="#atta"><b>attack</b></a> it.
						You roll with 1 <a href="#boon"><b>bane</b></a> if you use make a melee
						<a href="#atta"><b>attack</b></a>, 2 <a href="#boon"><b>banes</b></a> if you use an improvised weapon,
						or 3 <a href="#boon"><b>banes</b></a> if you use a ranged weapon. On a
						success, the target takes no <a href="#chi"><b>damage</b></a> (<a href="#chi"><b>bonus damage</b></a> does not apply), but makes an <a href="#att"><b>Agility</b></a> roll
						and drops one object it holds in its hands on the
						failure. If you can reach the target, you can use a
						<a href="#gen"><b>reactions</b></a> to catch the object. If the result of your
						roll is 20 or higher, the target takes 1d6 <a href="#chi"><b>damage</b></a>.

				 If you’re aware of your enemies when a new <a href="#gen"><b>round</b></a>
					starts, you can use a <a href="#gen"><b>reactions</b></a> to take the initiative,
					which lets you take a turn immediately before
					your enemies take their turns. If you and other
					allies take the initiative, you decide among
					yourself who goes first as normal, or the Sage does
					if no one can decide.
