            <h2>Strength</h2>
            <p> Strength represents muscle power, durability,
certain forms of athletic ability, and overall fitness.
You make a Strength roll to resist an effect that
forces you to move or that restrains you, as well as
when you climb, swim, attack with most hand-to-hand
weapons, kick down a door, or overpower
another creature. You also use Strength to
withstand or fight off the effects of pain, injury,
poison, or infection.

            <h2>Agility</h2>
            <p>Agility encompasses poise, dexterity, balance, and
reflexes. You make an Agility roll when you want
to keep your balance, perhaps because someone
has just shoved you or you are moving across
challenging terrain. Agility also comes into play
when you would try to accomplish a task that
requires manual dexterity, such as picking a lock,
disarming a trap, or performing an act of
legerdemain.
